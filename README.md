# React Practice Projects

Welcome to the React Practice Projects repository! This repository is dedicated to various React projects aimed at helping you practice and enhance your React skills. Currently, it contains one project, **Weather Card**, but it will be regularly updated with more exciting projects as I continue my practice.

## Projects

## 1. Weather Card 🌦️

## Overview

Weather Card is a React.js application that provides real-time weather updates for any location across the globe. The application displays essential weather information, including temperature, humidity, and the "feels like" temperature & weather. The user interface is enhanced with dynamically changing images and icons that reflect the current weather conditions.

## Features

- **Real-time Weather Data**: Fetches and displays the current weather conditions from a reliable weather API.
- **Temperature**: Shows the current temperature of the selected location.
- **Humidity**: Displays the current humidity level.
- **Feels Like**: Indicates how the temperature feels, considering factors like humidity and wind.
- **Dynamic Icons and Images**: The weather card dynamically changes its icons and background images based on the current weather conditions (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy).
- **Global Coverage**: Search and get weather updates for any city around the world.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The core framework used to build the UI components.
- **Axios**: For making API requests to retrieve weather data.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: The source of the weather data used in the application.
- **CSS**: For styling the application and ensuring a responsive design.
